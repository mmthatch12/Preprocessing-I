      <h3>Why I should be your next hire</h3>
      <p>I have found the career I've been searching for! 
        Going into college I did not know what I wanted to study.
        I ended up choosing accounting because I felt it was a practical career
        with many job opportunities. I worked hard and smart and was 
        able to become a Certified Public Accountant. I was employed in the Public
        accounting sector for over four years and though I enjoyed aspects
        of the profession I felt a desire to learn to build something others
        could use to benefit their lives. After some extensive career research,
        I decided that becoming a software engineer would allow me to fullfill my desire
        to learn how to build valuable things for others and allow me to continue to provide
        for my family. I have proven that I can do difficult things and overcome
        challenges. I want to be the software developer you need to help your
        company overcome the challenges it currently faces.</p>
